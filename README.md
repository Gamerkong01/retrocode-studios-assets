## About This Library

We believe in making retro game development accessible and fun. RetroCode Studios is an online platform that empowers creators to build browser-based retro games without needing complex software installations.

**Important Note:** The assets provided in this library are sourced exclusively from [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/), a fantastic resource for game developers. **RetroCode Studios did NOT create these assets.** We are simply providing a curated, convenient collection for use within our platform, all under the generous licensing provided by Kenney.

## How to Use These Assets in RetroCode Studios

To seamlessly integrate any asset from this library into your RetroCode Studios project (which leverages Phaser.js/Pixi.js for game development), you'll need the direct **raw GitHub URL** for each specific file.

**Quick Steps:**
1.  On this GitHub repository, navigate to the desired asset file (e.g., `SHOOTER/SpaceShooterRedux/PNG/playerShip1_blue.png`).
2.  Click the **"Raw"** button (usually at the top right of the file's content view).
3.  Copy the URL displayed in your browser's address bar. This is the direct link needed for your game.

**Example Usage in RetroCode Studios' Code Editor (Phaser.js):**
When setting up your game's assets in the `preload` function:

```javascript
function preload () {
    // Option 1: Set a base URL to simplify paths (recommended for asset packs)
    this.load.setBaseURL('[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gamerkong01/retrocode-studios-assets/main/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gamerkong01/retrocode-studios-assets/main/)');

    // Then load your assets using paths relative to the base URL
    this.load.image('player_ship', 'SHOOTER/SpaceShooterRedux/PNG/playerShip1_blue.png');
    this.load.audio('laser_sfx', 'SHOOTER/SpaceShooterRedux/Audio/sfx_laser.wav');
    this.load.spritesheet('character_atlas', 'PLATFORMER/NewPlatformerPack/spritesheets/character_atlas.png', { frameWidth: 32, frameHeight: 32 });

    // Option 2: Load with the full raw URL if no base URL is set, or for individual assets
    // this.load.image('enemy_ship', '[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gamerkong01/retrocode-studios-assets/main/SHOOTER/SpaceShooterRedux/PNG/enemyRed1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gamerkong01/retrocode-studios-assets/main/SHOOTER/SpaceShooterRedux/PNG/enemyRed1.png)');
}
